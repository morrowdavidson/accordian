        Rapid Fire Chat is a fun and relaxed interview podcast focused on the tech industry in San Antonio. Laura Ruiz-Roehrs and I co-host it. We collaborated on the design of a mobile-first website for the podcast. The goals were to create a site that reflected the personalities of the hosts, made it easy to listen, was fun to interact with, and was complex enough to be a highlight of our portfolios.
